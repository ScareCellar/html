    <q>If you shoot for the stars and miss, you'll still hit the sky</q>
    <p> - Cameron Troy</p>

    <p>After I graduate, I plan to work at a game Development company, learning skills necessary in the industry. I will likely stay in the field for several years, writing as a side hobby.</p>
    <p>In due time, I will begin to move towards starting my own Indie Game-Dev studio. I hope for this game dev studio to grow enough for me to be able to help other indie devs gain the funding and publicity necessary to bring their games to the next level.</p>
